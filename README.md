Solidity CRUD with Frontend and Tests
This repository contains a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application implemented in Solidity along with its frontend and tests.

Overview
The CRUD application is built using Solidity, a programming language commonly used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic functionalities to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data stored on the blockchain.

The frontend is designed to interact with the smart contract, allowing users to perform CRUD operations through a user-friendly interface.

Additionally, the repository includes tests to ensure the functionality and integrity of the smart contract. These tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to verify the correct behavior of the application.

Features
Solidity Smart Contract: Implements CRUD operations on the Ethereum blockchain.
Frontend Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the smart contract.
Test Suite: Includes a comprehensive suite of tests to validate the functionality of the smart contract.
Usage
To deploy and use the CRUD application, follow these steps:

Deploy the Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Set up the frontend application to interact with the deployed smart contract.
Use the frontend interface to perform CRUD operations on the blockchain data.
Dependencies
Solidity: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
Web3.js: Library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain nodes.
Truffle: Development framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
